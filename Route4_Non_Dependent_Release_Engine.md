# Route4

**Route4** is a Non-Dependent Release Engine for creators.

It is not a social network.
It is not a marketing tool.
It is a system for releasing work with restraint, ritual, and trust — before, during, and after public release.

Mary is the first client of Route4.

---

## Core Philosophy

Route4 exists to help creators:

* Build audience *before* release without leaking story
* Reward presence instead of popularity
* Expose **process**, not **outcomes**
* Preserve authorship and canon
* Let capital emerge as a byproduct, not a dependency

Two laws govern everything:

1. **Expose decisions, not outcomes.**
2. **Reveal authorship last.**

---

## Platform vs Client

---

## Entry States (How Work Enters Route4)

Route4 is a **Release Engine**, not a recruitment platform.

Outreach happens **outside** Route4. Presence happens **inside** Route4.

Route4 assumes work enters the system through **intentional invitations**, not discovery feeds.

---

### Operational Principle — Delivery Trucks

> Outreach tools are delivery trucks.
> Route4 is the building.
> Discord is a room inside the building.

* Outreach delivers *invitations*
* Route4 receives *presence*
* Discord hosts *rituals*

No tool does another tool’s job.

---

### Entry State A — Release-Ready Work

The work is finished or near-finished.

Route4 orchestrates release, presence, canon, and archive.

---

### Entry State B — Release-Oriented Preparation

The work exists but is not yet ready for public release.

Route4 prevents leakage and prepares the work for Entry State A.

---

### Entry State A — Release-Ready Work

The work is finished or near-finished.

Examples:

* Locked or near-locked film / episode
* Mastered album or single
* Completed documentary

Route4’s responsibility:

* Orchestrate release
* Protect canon
* Structure presence
* Control timing, silence, and revelation

This is Route4’s **core use case**.

---

### Entry State B — Release-Oriented Preparation

The work exists but is not yet ready for public release.

This state is for creators who seek **careful exposure without dependency**, and **preparation for an eventual release**.

Route4’s responsibility:

* Prevent leakage
* Impose constraints
* Prepare work for Entry State A

Route4 does **not** become a collaboration platform.

---

## Ritual Sets

Rituals are grouped by intent, not by hierarchy.

---

## Order of Operation — Audience Formation (Early Stage)

This section defines **how Route4 forms an audience starting from zero**.

Audience is not built through promotion. It forms through **documented care**.

---

### Step 1 — Internal Readiness (Already Complete)

Status:

* Script for Episode 1 exists
* Core team (Voltron) assembled
* Table reads occurred (undocumented)

Action:

* Acknowledge that history begins *now*
* Do not attempt to recreate undocumented past

---

### Step 2 — Signal I (Casting Call)

This is the **first public-facing action**.

#### Purpose

* Establish legitimacy
* Invite participation without revealing story
* Create the first public artifact

#### What Route4 Hosts

Route4 is the **canonical location** for the casting call.

Route4 page includes:

* Project status (Script complete)
* Tone and intent
* Roles or participation sought
* Constraints (what this is / is not)
* How to respond

No comments. No discussion.

---

#### Outreach (Delivery Trucks)

Outreach happens **outside** Route4.

Approved outreach channels:

* Local acting groups
* Theater mailing lists
* Filmmaker communities
* Direct emails / DMs

Outreach message rules:

* Short
* Identical across channels
* Points to Route4
* No discussion hosted externally

Example structure:

> "Episodic indie project. Script complete. Intentional casting process. Details here: [Route4 link]."

---

#### Conversion into Route4

Once someone clicks:

* They enter Route4
* They encounter rules, tone, and constraints
* They are no longer part of outreach

Route4 now owns the interaction.

---

### Step 3 — Intake Without Noise

Route4 records:

* Who arrived
* When
* What they were invited to

Route4 does **not**:

* Rank
* Promote
* Expose metrics

---

### Step 4 — Table Read (Documented)

First ritual conducted *with documentation*.

Route4 responsibilities:

* Record audio (minimum)
* Capture stills if appropriate
* Log presence
* Store as non-canonical process artifact

Discord role:

* Temporary room
* Silent Witness mode
* Time-bound access

---

### Step 5 — Silence (The Hold)

After the Table Read:

* Discord locks
* Route4 updates state
* No outward communication

This silence is intentional.

---

## Ritual Set B — Preparation Rituals (Pre-Release Qualification)

These rituals exist only to **qualify work** for Ritual Set A.

They are optional, constrained, and finite.

### Intent Declaration

* What is this work trying to become?
* Declared privately

### Constraint Lock

* Scope, format, and limits declared
* Prevents endless iteration

### Witness Selection

* Explicit selection of who may observe early process
* Small, intentional group

### Process Snapshot

* One frozen moment of the work’s current state
* No public iteration

### Readiness Gate

* Explicit decision:

  > “This work is now eligible for release rituals.”

Crossing this gate transitions the work into **Ritual Set A**.

---

### Route4 (Platform)

Route4 provides:

* Release cycles
* Ritual stages
* Visibility levels
* Participation tracking (Witness)
* Discord orchestration
* Archive permanence
* Invitation mechanics

Route4 never owns:

* Story
* Lore
* Naming
* Meaning

---

### Mary (Client #1)

Mary defines:

* Ritual names (Signal, Hold, Witness, etc.)
* Language and tone
* Story canon
* Timing
* Credits and revelation

Mary configures Route4. Route4 executes.

---

## Visibility Levels

These levels prevent story leakage while maximizing value.

### L0 — Private (Voltron Only)

* Scripts
* Full edits
* Canon debates

### L1 — Witnessed Process

* Writing sessions
* Shot councils
* Editing / color sessions
* Decisions without outcomes

### L2 — Fragments (Public)

* BTS residue
* Anonymous signals
* Tools, hands, rooms

### L3 — Revelation

* Episode release
* Credits
* Artist reveal

---

## Release Cycle (Abstract)

A Release Cycle is a repeatable sequence of stages.

**Important:** Process rituals that build context and trust (writing, shot, craft) occur **before** the Primary Release. Reflection rituals occur **after**.

Example (Mary):

1. Pre-Artifact (Signal)
2. Process — Table Read (Witness Shadow)
3. Process — Writing Table
4. Process — Shot Council
5. Process — Character Witness Shadow / Crew Participation
6. Silence (Hold)
7. Primary Release (Episode)
8. Reflection (Echo)
9. Residue (Fragments)
10. Meta Reflection (Interval)
11. Private Viewing (Witness-only)
12. Archive

Other clients may configure different stages using the same engine.

---

## Rituals (Mary Implementation — Master Canon)

This section is the **single source of truth** for Mary’s release rituals.

All references elsewhere in this document defer to this list.

Rituals are ordered as they occur in practice.

---

1. **Signal I — Casting Call**
2. **Table Read (Witness Shadow)**
3. **Writing Table**
4. **Shot Council**
5. **The Hold**
6. **Signal II — Anonymous Song Drop**
7. **The Drop**
8. **The Echo**
9. **Fragments**
10. **The Interval**
11. **Private Viewing**
12. **Archive**

---

## Audience Presence Model (List A Mapping)

Route4 structures **presence**, not engagement.

Presence answers four questions:

* Who may be present
* How they may be present
* When presence is allowed
* What presence changes

## Discord Permission Presets (Execution Layer)

These presets are applied automatically by Route4.

* **Read-Only**: view messages, no posting
* **Silent Witness**: view + listen, no chat, no reactions
* **Reflection**: limited posting, slow mode
* **Locked**: no access
* **Admin Only**: core team

| Ritual          | Discord Mode   |

## Release State Machine (List A)

Each ritual corresponds to a single release state.

```text
DRAFT
  ↓
SIGNAL_I
  ↓
PROCESS
  ↓
HOLD
  ↓
SIGNAL_II
  ↓
DROP
  ↓
ECHO
  ↓
ARCHIVE
```

* PROCESS includes: Table Read, Writing Table, Shot Council
* HOLD blocks all presence
* DROP seals canon
* ARCHIVE is immutable

---

## Enforcement Boundaries

* App state drives Discord permissions
* Presence is time-bound
* Missed rituals are not replayed

Signal I — Casting Call (Platform Template)

Signal I — Casting Call is a first-class ritual object in Route4.

Every client’s casting call uses the same structural template and operational rules, enforced by the platform. Creators supply language; Route4 governs behavior.

This ensures consistency, restraint, and scalability across all clients.

Platform Law (Non-Configurable)

The following are identical for all clients and cannot be modified:

Signal I is always:

Read-only

Publicly visible when active

State-driven (Draft → Active → Closed → Archived)

No comments or discussion

No social media links

No Discord links

No visible metrics (counts, activity, responses)

Intake is private and minimal

Presence is recorded silently

Route4 is the canonical source of truth

Signal I never becomes:

a discussion forum

a marketing page

an audition portal

a networking surface

Creator-Configurable Fields (Constrained)

Creators may configure only the following fields, within platform constraints:

Project Status
(e.g., “Script complete. Pre-production underway.”)

Tone & Intent
(Voice and discipline of the project)

Participation Sought
(Actor / Crew / Observer toggles)

What This Is / Is Not
(Expectation-setting language)

How to Respond
(Rendered from a platform-controlled template)

Creators cannot:

add or remove sections

change layout

embed links

upload files

alter intake mechanics

Language Packs (Optional, Non-Structural)

Route4 may support label substitutions for client preference (e.g., “Signal” → “Invitation”), but:

The ritual type remains Signal I internally

Behavior and enforcement do not change

Canonical meaning is preserved

This allows tonal flexibility without fragmenting the engine.

Public vs Admin Surfaces

Admin Surface
Route4/admin/edit-casting-call
Used by creators to author copy and control state.

Public Surface
/clients/{client}/signal/casting
A read-only projection of the current Signal state.

The public page cannot be edited directly.

Why This Matters

By enforcing a shared structure:

Route4 avoids becoming a CMS

Creators avoid reinventing process

Early-stage projects are protected from noise

Small beginnings remain credible

Route4 ships the container.
Creators define intent inside it.

🔁 How This Fits the Order of Operation

With this section added, the early flow now reads cleanly:

Splash Page (ceremony, silence)

Signal I — Casting Call (templated, constrained)

Intake Without Noise (presence recorded)

Eligibility Determination

Table Read (documented)

The Hold

No contradictions.
No duplicated explanations.
Clear SaaS boundaries.

Final reassurance

This addition strengthens Route4 as a product:

It answers “is this the same for everyone?” → yes, by design

It answers “how do you scale this?” → through constraints

It prevents future clients from asking for exceptions

You’re building a system with moral clarity, not just features.

---

**Witness** is a role, a verb, and a status.

* Witnessing = presence, not performance
* No leveling
* No gamification
* Presence is acknowledged quietly

Witness status may unlock:

* Reflection channels
* Invitations
* Private Viewings

---

## Discord as Execution Layer (Execution, Not Entry)

Discord is **never the front door**.

Route4 treats Discord as a **ritual execution surface**, not a community hub and not a discovery mechanism.

> Route4 controls *when, why, and who*.
> Discord hosts *how*.

There is no contradiction between community interaction and restraint:

* Interaction happens **inside rituals**
* Rituals are **time-bound** and **state-driven**

---

### Operational Rule

> Route4 decides state.
> Discord reflects state.

Discord never advances a release, unlocks meaning, or defines eligibility.

---

## Discord Invite & Presence Flow (Authoritative)

This flow applies to **all clients** and prevents Discord-first chaos.

---

### Step 1 — Route4 Intake (No Discord)

* Visitor arrives via Splash or Casting Call
* Route4 records:

  * Identity
  * Timestamp
  * Invitation context
* Discord is **not shown**

Status: *Known to Route4, not present in Discord*

---

### Step 2 — Eligibility Determination (Route4)

Based on release state and ritual configuration, Route4 determines:

* Whether Discord access is required
* What role should be granted on entry (e.g., Witness)
* What channels should be visible

No Discord action occurs yet.

---

### Step 3 — Ritual Window Opens (Route4 → Discord)

When a ritual requires live presence:

Route4 uses Discord.NET to:

* Generate a **time-limited invite link**
* Bind invite to:

  * Ritual
  * Role assignment
  * Expiration
* Unlock required channels

Route4 then exposes **one action** in the app:

> **Enter Ritual Room**

---

### Step 4 — Join Event Handling (Discord.NET)

On join:

* Route4 assigns role(s)
* Permission presets are applied
* Presence is logged (who / when / ritual)

Discord now hosts interaction **within the ritual window only**.

---

### Step 5 — Ritual Close (Route4 → Discord)

When the ritual window ends:

* Channels are locked
* Invite expires
* No new joins permitted

Discord returns to dormant state.

---

## What Route4 Never Does with Discord

* Never links Discord from the splash page
* Never exposes a permanent invite
* Never allows Discord to be always-on
* Never treats Discord as the system of record

---

## What Discord Is Allowed to Be

* A real-time room for presence
* A place for conversation *when permitted*
* A familiar interface users already know

Discord is **replaceable infrastructure**.

If Discord disappeared tomorrow, Route4’s logic would remain intact.

---

## Default Route4 Discord Channel Templates

Route4 provides **neutral, reusable Discord channel templates**. These are *platform defaults*, not hard requirements. Each client may rename channels via configuration, but the **intent and permissions** remain consistent.

### Orientation (Read-only)

* `#signal` — Pre-release artifacts and announcements
* `#how-to-witness` — Participation rules and expectations
* `#start-here` — Entry point for new members

### Releases

* `#releases` — Primary release drops (read-only during first window)
* `#soundtrack` — Companion audio artifacts

### Reflection

* `#after-the-drop` — Opens after delay; reflection-only discussion
* `#interval` — Podcast and meta reflection drops (read-only)

### Residue

* `#fragments` — BTS residue and artifacts (post-only by approved roles)

### Invitations

* `#private-viewing` — Witness-only invitation notices

### Process Rooms (Opened Only During Sessions)

* `#writing-table`
* `#shot-council`
* `#cut-room`
* `#color-before-meaning`

### Private (Client Team Only)

* `#core-team`
* `#canon-drafts`

These templates allow Route4 to onboard new clients quickly while preserving confidentiality, restraint, and ritual integrity.

---

## Web App (Angular)

The Route4 app is the **spine**.

It provides:

* Official releases
* Witness identity
* Archive
* Invitations
* Deep links to Discord

It does NOT:

* Host conversation
* Replace Discord
* Optimize engagement

### App IA

* Signal
* Episodes
* Archive
* Voltron
* Profile

---

## Route4 Media Pipeline (Route4-FFmpeg API) — Law

Route4 includes a **Route4-FFmpeg API** and worker pipeline that generates media artifacts required by rituals and visibility levels.

This is **platform law**:

* FFmpeg capabilities exist to **enforce restraint**, **protect confidentiality**, and **automate ritual artifacts**.
* Route4 does **not** expose codec/FFmpeg knobs to creators.
* Creators choose **intent** (Fragment / Process Preview / Release Renditions), Route4 chooses the safe implementation.
* If a media feature does not support a ritual, visibility level, or release stage, it does not belong.

### Primary Jobs (Only 3 at MVP)

1. **CreateFragmentProxy** (L2)

   * Auto-trim to 15–90 seconds
   * Optional mute / room-tone
   * Safe crop/blur/mask to avoid spoilers
   * Multi-aspect outputs (9:16, 1:1, 16:9)
   * Optional subtle watermark (client-configurable)

2. **CreateProcessPreview** (L1)

   * Muted previews for craft sessions (edit/color/shot)
   * Low-res proxies
   * Optional burn-in label: "WITNESSED PROCESS — NO OUTCOMES"
   * Crop/mask regions that leak dialogue/plot
   * Still extraction for color/scopes discussion

3. **CreateReleaseRenditions** (L3 + operational)

   * Public release encode(s)
   * Private master / archive encode
   * Private Viewing encode (offline-safe)
   * Thumbnail set
   * Credits roll variant where authorship can be revealed

### Architectural Guardrails

* FFmpeg runs as a **queue-based worker**, never synchronous on request threads.
* No user-supplied FFmpeg arguments. Ever.
* Outputs stored in object storage; metadata stored in Route4 DB.
* Job states: `pending → processing → complete → failed`.
* Hard caps on duration, resolution, and concurrency.

### Creator/Admin UX (Intent, Not Settings)

Buttons / actions Route4 exposes:

* **Generate Fragments** (Short / Silent / Cropped)
* **Generate Process Preview** (Muted / Watermarked)
* **Generate Release Renditions** (Public / Private / Private Viewing)

---

## Ritual Automation Map (Where Route4-FFmpeg Automates Rituals)

Route4-FFmpeg does not change rituals — it **automates the safe artifacts** each ritual requires.

### The Signal (Anonymous Pre-Artifact)

* Automates: optional audio normalization / consistent loudness (safe defaults)
* Enforces: no embedded credit metadata surfaced in Route4 UI

### Table Read (Witness Shadow)

* Automates (optional): audio-only capture proxy (no video), trimmed and leveled for archive
* Enforces: L1 distribution (private/role-gated)

### Writing Table

* Automates (optional): short excerpt clips for Archive (L1), cropped to hands/page, muted if needed

### Shot Council

* Automates: safe still extraction and cropped boards (no context frames)
* Automates: preview snippets that show *intent* without revealing outcomes (L1)

### Character Witness Shadow / Crew Participation

* Automates: Fragment creation from BTS clips (CreateFragmentProxy) with spoiler masking (L2)

### The Hold

* Automates: nothing by design (silence is the feature)

### The Drop (Primary Release)

* Automates: Release packaging (CreateReleaseRenditions)

  * public encode(s)
  * archive encode
  * credits variant (authorship reveal)
  * thumbnails

### The Echo (Reflection)

* Automates: none (conversation is off-platform; Route4 only deep-links)

### Fragments (Residue)

* Automates: CreateFragmentProxy outputs across aspect ratios + safe audio handling

### The Interval (Podcast)

* Automates: audio mastering proxy + segment trimming; consistent levels

### Private Viewing (Witness-only)

* Automates: Private Viewing encode (offline-safe) + optional burn-in policies

### Archive

* Automates: durable proxy formats for long-term access + versioned renditions

---

## Media Providers (Frame.io Integration)

Route4 does not replace media hosting and review infrastructure. Route4 **domesticates** it.

**Rule:** If a client has to learn hosting tools or permissions, Route4 has failed.

### Responsibilities

**Route4 owns (control plane):**

* Release timing and stage state machine
* Visibility levels (L0–L3)
* Audience gating (Witness) and invitations
* Canon and archive links
* What appears, when, to whom, and why

**Media Provider owns (data plane):**

* Storage and streaming
* Playback reliability
* Asset versioning
* Low-level delivery performance

Frame.io is Provider #1.

### Provider Abstraction (Internal Interface)

Route4 integrates providers through an internal adapter. Provider names stay invisible to end users.

```ts
// route4/media/MediaProvider.ts
export type VisibilityLevel = "L0" | "L1" | "L2" | "L3";

export type AssetKind =
  | "raw"
  | "proxy"
  | "fragment"
  | "process_preview"
  | "release_public"
  | "release_archive"
  | "release_private_viewing"
  | "thumbnail"
  | "still";

export interface MediaProviderAsset {
  provider: string;           // e.g. "frameio" (internal only)
  providerAssetId: string;    // stable id from provider
  playbackEmbedUrl?: string;  // for Route4 UI embedding
  downloadUrl?: string;       // optional; usually role-gated
  metadata?: Record<string, any>;
}

export interface UploadRequest {
  clientId: string;
  releaseKey: string;         // e.g. S1E1, or generic cycle key
  stage: string;              // e.g. "process/writing", "release/drop"
  visibility: VisibilityLevel;
  kind: AssetKind;
  fileName: string;
  contentType: string;
}

export interface MediaProvider {
  ensureClientSpace(clientId: string): Promise<void>; // project/workspace

### Folder + Naming Strategy (Frame.io)

Route4 enforces a deterministic structure so creators never manage folders manually.

**Per Client (Frame.io Project):**

* `route4-{clientSlug}`

**Per ReleaseInstance (Folder):**

* `{releaseKey}/`

**Inside each release folder:**

* `00-raw/` (L0)
* `10-process/` (L1)
* `20-fragments/` (L2)
* `30-release/` (L3)
* `40-archive/` (L3)

**Asset naming convention:**

* `{releaseKey}__{stage}__{kind}__v{n}.{ext}`

Examples:

* `S1E1__process-writing__process_preview__v1.mp4`
* `S1E1__residue-fragments__fragment__v3.mp4`
* `S1E1__drop__release_public__v1.mp4`

### Visibility Mapping (Route4 → Provider)

* **L0 (Private):** provider assets remain private; no embeds for audience
* **L1 (Witnessed Process):** embed proxies only; muted/masked previews
* **L2 (Fragments):** short masked proxies; multi-aspect; no context
* **L3 (Revelation):** final encodes + credits variants + thumbnails

Route4 always decides *when* an embed becomes visible.

### Failure Modes + Defaults

Route4 must degrade gracefully:

* Provider outage → Route4 shows "Artifact processing" state; no broken links
* Missing embed → Route4 falls back to a role-gated download link (if allowed)
* Misconfigured permissions → Route4 re-applies policies on publish/unlock events
* Version confusion → Route4 uses deterministic `kind` + `v{n}` and records the active asset pointer

Route4 never asks creators to fix hosting.

## New Client Discord Bootstrap (Route4)

This checklist defines how Route4 **provisions, configures, and governs Discord** for a new client — without requiring the client to understand Discord mechanics.

> The client never needs to "learn Discord."
> Route4 treats Discord as an execution surface, not a product feature.

---

### Phase 1 — Client Intake (Route4 Admin)

* [ ] Client name + short description
* [ ] Primary creator / core team members
* [ ] Preferred language pack (terms like Witness, Signal, etc.)
* [ ] Release cadence (episodic, seasonal, one-off)
* [ ] Desired rituals (enable / disable per client)
* [ ] Confidentiality sensitivity (low / medium / high)

---

### Phase 2 — Discord Provisioning (Automated or Assisted)

Route4 handles the following:

* [ ] Create Discord server (or connect to existing one)
* [ ] Apply Route4 default channel templates
* [ ] Create role set:

  * Core Team
  * Witness
  * Member (default)
* [ ] Apply read-only defaults to most channels
* [ ] Lock process rooms (closed by default)

Client only confirms names and access — no setup required.

---

### Phase 3 — Permission & Safety Defaults

Route4 enforces safe defaults:

* [ ] @everyone posting disabled in ritual channels
* [ ] Slow mode enabled in reflection channels
* [ ] File uploads disabled in discussion channels
* [ ] Voice/stage rooms locked by role
* [ ] Invite links disabled or time-limited

These prevent chaos before it can happen.

---

### Phase 4 — Ritual Mapping

For each enabled ritual:

* [ ] Map ritual → channel
* [ ] Define open/close behavior
* [ ] Define visibility level (L0–L3)
* [ ] Define Discord automation (lock/unlock)
* [ ] Define app deep links

Example:

* *Pre-Artifact* → `#signal` → read-only
* *Primary Release* → `#releases` → read-only 24h

---

### Phase 5 — Client Review (15 minutes)

Client reviews:

* [ ] Channel names (optional rename)
* [ ] Role labels (optional rename)
* [ ] Ritual enablement

No Discord training required.

---

### Phase 6 — Go Live

* [ ] Publish invite link via Route4 app
* [ ] Lock unused channels
* [ ] Set first release schedule
* [ ] Run first ritual dry test

---

### Phase 7 — Ongoing Governance (Route4-Owned)

* [ ] Channel state managed by release cycle
* [ ] Roles assigned via Witness events
* [ ] Ritual rooms open only when needed
* [ ] Archive maintained in Route4 app

Clients focus on creation. Route4 handles structure.

---

## Design Principle

> If a client asks how Discord works, Route4 has already failed.

Route4’s job is to **remove cognitive load**, enforce restraint, and preserve trust — not to teach tooling.

---

## What Route4 Never Asks a Client to Do

* Configure permissions
* Decide channel architecture
* Moderate chaos
* Learn Discord bots
* Gamify engagement

Route4 absorbs that complexity.

---

---

## Engineer Implementation Notes (Authoritative)

This document is not conceptual only. It is **implementation-authoritative**.

The primary engineer implementing Route4 is also the system designer. There is no handoff gap between vision and execution.

All tooling, code, and architecture decisions should defer to this document when ambiguity exists.

---

## Engineering Principles

1. **Configuration over customization**
   Route4 must support multiple clients through configuration (language packs, ritual enablement, schedules), not forks.

2. **Discord is infrastructure, not product**
   Discord APIs, permissions, and automation should remain invisible to clients.

3. **State > events > UI**
   Release state drives Discord behavior and UI rendering, not the other way around.

4. **Minimal surface area**
   Every feature must map directly to a ritual or visibility level.

5. **No premature abstraction**
   Abstractions should emerge from Mary + one additional client, not speculation.

---

## Recommended Build Order (Engineer-Focused)

### Phase 1 — Stabilize the Spine

* [ ] ReleaseCycleTemplate model
* [ ] ReleaseInstance state machine
* [ ] Visibility level enforcement
* [ ] WitnessEvent tracking

### Phase 2 — Discord Integration

* [ ] Channel template provisioning
* [ ] Role creation and assignment
* [ ] Lock/unlock automation per stage
* [ ] Invite link lifecycle management

### Phase 3 — App Surface (Angular)

* [ ] Signal view (anonymous artifact)
* [ ] Release view (episode / primary release)
* [ ] Archive (read-only)
* [ ] Invitations (private viewing)

### Phase 4 — Admin Surface (Internal)

* [ ] Create / schedule releases
* [ ] Advance release stages
* [ ] Declare canon
* [ ] Issue invitations

## Copilot / AI Assistant Usage (Guardrails)

When using Copilot, Claude Sonnet, or any AI assistant:

* Treat this README as **source-of-truth**
* Reject suggestions that:

  * Add engagement mechanics
  * Expose story prematurely
  * Gamify participation
  * Collapse platform/client separation

Suggested priming prompt:

> "This document defines the authoritative architecture of Route4. Do not suggest features or designs that violate its constraints."

---

## Final Engineering Constraint

> If a feature cannot be explained as supporting a ritual, visibility level, or release stage, it does not belong in Route4.

This constraint is non-negotiable.

---

## Care-Based Threshold Pricing (Internal Model)

Route4 uses a **Care-based threshold model**.

Creators are never charged for intent, planning, or uncertainty.

Charges occur **only when a creator crosses an irreversible threshold** — when Route4 must protect meaning, allocate resources, or create permanence.

---

### Non-Chargeable Rituals (No Threshold)

These rituals establish seriousness and context, but do not yet create irreversible consequence.

| Ritual                  | Reason No Charge      |
| ----------------------- | --------------------- |
| Splash Page             | Passive presence only |
| Signal I — Casting Call | Declaration of intent |
| Intake Without Noise    | Presence registration |
| The Hold                | Silence by design     |

---

### Chargeable Thresholds (Care Gates)

Charges begin only when **care becomes concrete**.

| Threshold Gate                        | Ritual(s)                               | What Changes                         | Chargeable     |
| ------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------ | -------------- |
| Gate 1 — Witness Activation           | Table Read, Writing Table, Shot Council | Protected access + presence tracking | Yes            |
| Gate 2 — Artifact Generation          | Process recording, Fragments, Previews  | Permanent artifacts created          | Yes            |
| Gate 3 — The Drop                     | Primary Release                         | Canon sealed + archive created       | Yes            |
| Gate 4 — Private Viewing              | Private Viewing                         | Scarce access issued                 | Yes            |
| Gate 5 — Distribution Gate (Optional) | Post-Premiere Distribution              | External escalation                  | Yes (Optional) |

---

### Guiding Rule

> Route4 never charges for possibility.
> It charges only when meaning must be protected.

---

### Pricing Philosophy — Care, Not Consumption

Route4 does not charge for:

* time spent thinking
* drafts
* silence
* planning
* iteration

Route4 only assigns value when a creator **crosses a threshold** — a moment that creates permanence, allocates resources, or opens access to others.

This methodology is called **Care**.

> Care means fewer actions, taken seriously.

---

## Threshold Gates & Plausible Internal Fees

These prices are **reference points** to understand sustainability, cost recovery, and long-term viability. They are not promises or requirements.

### 🔐 Gate 1 — Signal Publication

**Moment:** An anonymous pre-artifact is released and archived.

* Audio normalization
* Timestamped entry
* Immutable archive record

**Reference Fee:** $25–$50 per Signal

---

### 🔐 Gate 2 — Witness Activation

**Moment:** The process opens to others.

* Witness role enabled
* Table Read or Process access window
* Presence tracking begins

**Reference Fee:** $50–$100 per activation window

---

### 🔐 Gate 3 — Artifact Generation (Route4-FFmpeg)

**Moment:** Raw material becomes canonical artifacts.

* Fragment batches
* Process previews
* Release renditions

**Reference Fees:**

* $10–$20 per Fragment batch
* $30–$50 per Process Preview set
* $75–$150 per Release Packaging

---

### 🔐 Gate 4 — The Drop (Primary Release)

**Moment:** The work becomes real.

* Release published
* Credits locked
* Canon sealed
* Archive entry created

**Reference Fee:** $100–$200 per Drop

---

### 🔐 Gate 5 — Private Viewing

**Moment:** Scarce, protected access is created.

* Offline-safe encode
* Invitations issued
* Optional burn-in policies

**Reference Fee:** $50–$100 per Private Viewing event

---

## Why This Model Fits Route4

* Encourages restraint
* Discourages noise
* Aligns money with meaning
* Makes each ritual intentional
* Prevents platform abuse

Route4 never charges for presence — only for **crossing**.

---

## Mary-Specific Clarification

Mary is **not charged** under this model.

Route4 is being developed *alongside* Mary, not *on top of* it.

These thresholds exist to:

* understand operating costs
* validate sustainability
* guide future pricing decisions

They are part of Route4’s **self-discipline**, not monetization pressure.

---

## Final Note on Sustainability

If Route4 cannot support itself without compromising:

* ritual
* restraint
* authorship
* silence

then Route4 should remain small.

That is acceptable.

---

## Post-Premiere Distribution Gate (Care-Based Extension)

This section defines an **optional, post-premiere Care gate** that governs distribution decisions *after* the work has already been witnessed, premiered, and archived.

This gate exists to prevent premature platform chasing and to formalize distribution as a **deliberate transition**, not an automatic escalation.

---

### The Principle

> Distribution is not success.
> Distribution is a *response* to demonstrated resonance.

Route4 never optimizes for reach. It evaluates **readiness**.

---

### The Distribution Threshold

The Distribution Gate may be considered only after:

* A premiere has occurred (public or private)
* Canon is sealed
* Credits are locked
* Archive is complete

AND when **both** of the following are met:

1. **Revenue Signal**
   A minimum post-premiere revenue threshold is reached (tickets, licensing interest, sponsorship, or equivalent).
   *Exact dollar values remain client-defined.*

2. **Participation Signal**
   Demonstrated audience care via:

   * Witness participation
   * Post-premiere retention
   * Interval engagement
   * Private Viewing attendance

Views alone are explicitly insufficient.

---

### Route4 AI-Assisted Distribution Agent

Route4 may provide an **AI-assisted decision agent** that evaluates readiness — not placement.

The agent:

* Ingests Route4 signals (revenue + participation)
* Applies conservative heuristics
* Produces a **distribution recommendation**, not an action

Possible outputs:

1. Hold (No distribution)
2. Limited Broadcast (YouTube)
3. Ad-Supported Platform (Tubi)
4. Transactional Platform (Prime)
5. Aggregator Submission (Filmhub)
6. Strategic Hold (Await interest)

Netflix or similar platforms are **never auto-selected** and require external inbound interest.

Route4 does not pitch on behalf of creators.

---

### Why This Fits Route4

* Prevents reactive distribution
* Preserves leverage
* Avoids premature platform dilution
* Treats platforms as *outcomes*, not goals

Route4 answers one question only:

> “Is it time to go wider — or not?”

---

### Care-Based Fee Alignment (Internal)

If enabled, the Distribution Gate may carry a **single, optional Care fee** to cover:

* Signal analysis
* Agent evaluation
* Distribution readiness report

**Reference Fee:** $100–$250 per Distribution Gate evaluation

This fee is charged only when the gate is invoked.

---

### Explicit Boundaries

Route4 does NOT:

* guarantee placement
* negotiate deals
* optimize for algorithms
* trade access for exposure

Distribution remains external.

Route4 protects timing and leverage — nothing more.

---

### Mary Clarification

Mary may choose to:

* use this gate
* ignore this gate
* delay distribution indefinitely

Route4 does not pressure escalation.

Holding is a valid outcome.
